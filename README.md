# TubeK12

[Discontinued, use [CustomTube](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/customtube/) instead. It's better anyway.]

An attempt to recreate the 2012 YouTube layout using CSS.

It is available as a [userstyle](https://userstyles.world/style/5130/tubek12-2012-youtube-recreation).

Description from userstyles.world

A coding experiment, since I’m still pretty new to this stuff.

It started off as an attempt to recreate the 2013-2017 layout, but quickly evolved into an attempt to recreate the 2012 one, though there are still some remnants of the 2013 layout recreation in some places.

It’s incomplete, and I plan on updating it. A few things to note though:
1. I don’t have first hand experience with the 2012 layout, so old YouTube screenshots and pages on the Wayback Machine were all I had to go off of when I made this style.
2. Because the 2012 layout in its original form is fundamentally very different from 2017-Present YouTube, a 100% faithful recreation is (probably) impossible.
3. It might not work with all zoom levels on all monitors.
4. It is being developed for Firefox first and foremost, there might be minor issues in Chromium. Although I try to fix those whenever possible.
5. Not compatible with YouTube Redux, 7ktTube, or any other major layout changing scripts.
6. Dark mode compatibility isn’t 100%.
7. When I’m not certain how something looked in 2012/it didn’t exist in 2012, I will either: Make it look like it did in 2013-2017, or try to make it look like it fits in with the rest of the design.
8. TubeK12 is by no means stable (not yet anyway). Expect bugs.
