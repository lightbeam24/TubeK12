# TubeK12
An attempt to recreate the 2012 YouTube layout using CSS.

It is available as a [userstyle](https://userstyles.world/style/5130/tubek12-2012-youtube-recreation).

Description from userstyles.world

A coding experiment, since I’m still pretty new to this stuff.

It started off as an attempt to recreate the 2013-2017 layout, but quickly evolved into an attempt to recreate the 2012 one, though there are still some remnants of the 2013 layout recreation in some places.

It’s incomplete, and I plan on updating it. A few things to note though:
1. I don’t have first hand experience with the 2012 layout, so old YouTube screenshots and pages on the Wayback Machine were all I had to go off of when I made this style.
2. I made this (referring to v1.0.0) from scratch in less than a week. Don’t expect perfection.
3. Because the 2012 layout in its original form is fundamentally very different from 2017-Present YouTube, a 100% faithful recreation is (probably) impossible.
4. It might not work with all zoom levels on all monitors.
5. It is being developed for Firefox first and foremost, there might be minor issues in Chromium.
6. Not compatible with YouTube Redux, 7ktTube, or any other major layout changing scripts.
7: Not compatible with dark mode (this may change in a future update).
